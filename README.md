# brain_cancer_gene_expression
Project Theme:
This project involves data processing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification using Python and various libraries for the brain cancer gene expression data

Description:
          The code handles gene data related to brain cancer. The process begins with data preparation, followed by an exploration of the target distribution and features, dimensionality reduction, dataset splitting, training of several machine learning models (Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest), performance evaluation, and a majority vote to combine predictions for increased accuracy. In essence, it's a thorough procedure for dissecting this dataset, creating models, and using group techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
                To sum it up, this code illustrates a methodical approach to managing gene data related to brain cancer. To increase prediction accuracy, it applies machine learning models and an ensemble technique in addition to preprocessing and exploring the dataset. In the context of brain cancer gene categorization, this all-encompassing method facilitates a thorough understanding of the data and leverages the strength of numerous models for more reliableÂ predictions.
